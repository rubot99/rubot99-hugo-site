It’s been about 4 years since I last blogged, stuff has got in the way and I have just not been bothered. Anyway this year I want to start blogging again – a hello world reboot ;).

<!--more-->

So this year one my resolutions has been to write twelve blog post by December 2017. Hopefully by the end of the year I would have achieved this goal. I’m going to try and blog on technology, development and my experience on keto.
To kick start my blogging goal I decided to use a new blogging platform. I’ve got my new blog all set up now. So I guess rubot is locked and loaded :)
