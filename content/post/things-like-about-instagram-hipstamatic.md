In the last couple of months I have been getting into iPhone photography or as it is more popularly known as iPhoneography. 
I started out by using Instagram and have now graduated to using both Instagram and Hipstamatic. 
At first glance I thought these apps were similar and favoured Instagram because of its ease of use.

However on further examination of Hipstamatic I realised that these apps are for different scenarios.

### Things I like about Instagram
1. Adding a picture to your Instagram feed is quick and easy.
2. Ability to process pictures taken previously or with another camera.

### Things I like about Hipstamatic
1. Large number of lens, film and flash options which provide a variety of effects.
2. Additional lens, film and flash packs.
3. Ability to get hard copy prints of your pictures.

### Conclusion
After using both apps for sometime I have realised both apps are a must for my iphone photography kit. I like to take quick pictures with the iPhone camera app and then later review and process them with Instagram. When I have time to try different compositions, I like to use Hipstamatic as it gives me more options. Both these apps are great and I would recommend them to anyone starting out with iPhone photography.
