Yesterday I attended the Developer, Developer, Developer event in Glasgow. It was the first time I have been to a DDD event and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The event was well organised and the content in the sessions were excellent. The event thoroughly exceeded my expectations. There were so many interesting sessions that if I had the chance I would have attended them all.

I attended the following sessions at DDD:

CQRS and Friends: Possibly distributed systems, intentionally  – Andrea Magnorsky

This was an introductory session on CQRS/ES.

Caliburn.Micro: Painless MVVM apps for Silverlight and WPF – Barry Carr

This session was a good introduction to using Caliburn Micro with Silverlight. The step by step code demo on using Caliburn Micro was really useful and good. Caliburn Micro seems like a really cool MVVM framework and I am planning try it out on a small project.

Unit Testing, Test Driven Development and the Walking Skeleton – Seb Rose

A detailed talk explaining TDD and the pros and pit falls you might face when using TDD in your team.

Is your code S.O.L.I.D? – Nathan Gloyn

I initially was expecting this talk to be a detailed description about SOLID principles, but was pleasantly surprised to see that Nathan had code examples too.

Functional Alchemy: Tricks to keep your C# DRY* – Mark Rendle

This was another excellent session with a great code demo. One of the things Mark discussed was a try-catch functional strategy which I think I’m going to start using in my code.

It was a great developer event and I am tempted to go to the DDD South West event next month.
