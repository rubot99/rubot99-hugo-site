So this book is about improving your career, life and achieving your goals. It's not a book about any technical aspects of software development. This book takes a holistic approach to improving your software development career i.e. you need to focus on multiple area of your life not just a few to improve your career. In today’s market just having technical expertise is not enough to get ahead in your career.

This book is divided in four main area

#### Career

##### Tools to help achieve your goals and pitfalls

*Jobs are owned by the company but you own your career - Earl Nightingale*
Your career is your responsibility, people often make the mistake that they don’t need to worry about their career since they work for someone else. You need to treat your software career as a business, this is a mistake most people make, they delegate the responsibility of their career to their employer. Most of us work for a company, but our skills and trade belong to us. We need to look at our employer as a customer. Looking at our employer this way moves us from a position of powerlessness and dependency to autonomy and self-decision. Being a generalist early on in your career is helpful, but to grow in your career you need to focus on being a specialist. Every company values people who are not only a problem solver, but who can execute on them. Keeping a log of your activities, keeping a weekly report, giving presentation, and speaking up in meetings will help you stand out.

You also need a big far off goal that is not too specific but one that will help you navigate yourself towards this goal by completing smaller goals. Smaller goals help us course correct and gives rewards to help us stay the course.

All jobs have to deal with people as its primary requirement, you cannot win a person's heart without words of encouragement and keeping their pride intact. Rewarding a positive behaviour is more effective than punishing a negative behaviour. Words of encouragement help inspire people and promote change.

##### Marketing Yourself

Talent alone will only get you so far in life, the difference between great musicians and super stars is marketing. Marketing is a multiplier for talent. Good marketing helps amplify your talent and helps you stand out from the crowd.

Having a blog helps you brand and market yourself, having a tag line, elevator pitch, your niche and visuals will help you create your own brand. To increase the popularity of your blog ensure you have good content, write consistently, increase your online profile. To increase your profile, try posting thoughtful comments on other people's blogs and where possible link back to your own blog. Share your blog post on social media and add a link to your blog on your email signature. Research what is the current hot topics and write on them.
